# HTML-and-CSS-Basics

HTML and CSS form the foundation of modern web design, allowing you to create visually appealing & functional web pages.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It is used to structure content and add elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to describe the presentation of HTML documents. It allows you to control layout and appearance by defining styles for elements such as fonts, colors, margins, borders, and more.
